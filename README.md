## Installation
Either access the Heroku webpage [here](https://warm-tundra-24173.herokuapp.com/), or copy the code and run it locally. To run it locally a user will need a code editor like Visual Studio Code, with mySql installed and node js. From there you will need the dependencies: bcrypt, connect-session-sequelize, dotenv, express, express-handlebars, express-session, mysql2, and sequelize. Then source the schema file to create the database. once you have your .env set up, you can "npm run dev" in the console to start it up on a localhost.

## Usage
From the home page, click on one of the nav links up top. You'll want to head to the Sign Up page, and create an account with your email and password. From there it will redirect you to your dashboard where you can see your previously made posts, and the ability to create a new one. Once you click submit on the new blog post it saves it and you can access it on the home page as well as the blog posts of all other users. Once you're done, just click Log out in the navigation bar.
